Vigenere cipher is a system of polyalphabetic substitution encryption in which the same letter of the clear message can, depending on its position in it, be replaced by different letters, unlike a mono-alphabetic encryption system such as the Caesar cipher (which he uses however as a component). This method thus resists frequency analysis, which is a decisive advantage over mono-alphabetic encryption. However Vigenereâ€™s figure was drilled by Prussian major Friedrich Kasiski who published his method in 1863. Since then, it offers no security.
